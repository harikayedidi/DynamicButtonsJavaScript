# DynamicButtonsJavaScript
This is my simple JavaScript code to create tables, given number of rows and columns with dynamic buttons in JavaScript. I wrote this code for a professor for his research on Human Behavior.

This code to genrates table(s) with buttons and the buttons when clicked increments the count of numbers in the respective box. After all the clicks, you can export the data into an excel spreadsheet or you can email it to yourself.
